1. Create a measurable scenario to compare between the original evaluator and the one with analysis.

2. Implement a method to track the total time to evaluate the scenario expression.

3. Using the time spent evaluating in the new evaluator with analysis, determine the fraction of time spent in the analysis phase.

The evaluator using analysis is significantly more efficient for recursive procedures, as well as any procedures called more than once.

When creating a procedure with define, most of the work of creating the definition is done in the analysis phase.
However, when executing the procedure, most of the work is done in the execution phase, the analysis phase takes 0 milliseconds
compared to the execution time. This is for the example procedure using iteration.

I am recording the time in milliseconds (mit/scheme docs say ticks are currently measured in milliseconds), and when
evaluating a procedure, the definition phase always has time spent in the analysis phase, with it's execution
portion (writing the symbol to the environment) is basically 0.
However, when executing that same procedure after the definition, 0 time is spent in the analysis phase, all the time is spent in the 
execution part.
Given that one of the phases is always 0 while the other is not, it is impossible for me to give an accurate fraction of time
spent in the analyses phase.
When testing expressions that aren't recursive or iterative, to little time is spent to produce an
accurate answer.
