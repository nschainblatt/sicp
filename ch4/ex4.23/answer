Alyssa's analyze-sequence procedure will perform the same loop to call the analyzed execution procedures each time
the procedure in question is called.
Basically her method returns a execution procedure which calls another procedure to loop and execute the bodies expression execution
procedures. The loop procedure is called each time the procedure in question is called.

With the original analyze-sequence version, we only loop once to build the wrapping execution procedure, subsequent calls to the
procedure in question will be able to reuse the wrapping execution procedure instead of looping again.
The original version returns a single, wrapping execution procedure that sequentially calls each expressions execution procedure
without looping.

For a sequence containing a single expression, the amount of work to be done in either versions will be roughly the same.
However, Alyssa's version will still call the loop procedure, but since we only have one expression it will be limited to one
iteration, but this iteration is invoked every time the procedure in question is called.
The original method will loop once (also with only one iteration) in the analyze part, and never again during execution.
The original method is slightly more efficient, but wouldn't be very noticeable with one expression in the body.

However, with 2+ expressions the increase in the amount of work to be done will be more noticeable, as each iteration will be performed
each time the procedure in question is used.
