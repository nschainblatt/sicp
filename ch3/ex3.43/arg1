1. The account balances after any number of concurrent exchanges with the first version of the 'exchange' procedure will still
   end up being $10, $20, and $30 in some order. The only way that the set of account balances would remain 10, 20 and 30 would be if we executed the exchanges one at a time
   with no overlap.

2. Time diagram attachment

3. The account balance sum of accounts 1, 2, and 3 would be preserved using the non-serialized version of exchange only if the
   exchanges were executed one at a time, similar to the first question.

4. Same time diagram attachment


Note that the exchange and all withdraw and deposit procedures within each account involved in the exchange must be serialized
to guarantee the integrity of all account balances involved. There can be no access to a account balance that is the middle of
another transaction.
