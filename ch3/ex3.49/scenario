A scenario where the ordered account ID deadlock solution would not work is if the way the accounts are generating their unique
IDs is not thread safe.

If two distinct accounts were given the same account ID, this could cause the same deadlock issue from before to occur.

For example:
Given account a1 with id 1, and account a2 also with id 1, and two concurrent exchanges happening in the opposite direction:
P1: exchange (a1 -> a2)
P2: exchange (a2 -> a1)

The serializers would always begin in the same order because the if condition would always evaluate to false (because lesser
than fails due to having the same account id value).

Since the only difference in the two exchanges is the order in the account arguments, this would make P1 acquire a2's
serializer mutex first. Since we are assuming this is happening at the same time, P2 would acquire a1's serializer mutex
since the account arguments are in the opposite order and the if condition also fails.
Now P1 has a1's mutex, and P2 has a2's mutex, P1 now needs a2's mutex but has not released a1 yet and P2 needs that mutex to be 
free in order to acquire it. This has resulted in a deadlock.
